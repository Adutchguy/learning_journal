## LJ Code 201 - Day 13

The code review was helpful. I was able to work out the concept for local storage and even helped several other classmates implement the concept in their own code providing a step by step explanation of the stack. I also attended a meet-up this evening, and while the topic was about async and above my knowledge level, I still found it interesting and a worthwhile event.
