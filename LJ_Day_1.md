# LJ Code 201 - Day 1

Today we did introductions and learned a little bit about our fellow students. This was enjoyable as we were able to see the wide range of individuals and the diverse backgrounds. Very cool.

We ran through the basics of HTML and touched on CSS very briefly, and then ran over JavaScript for a little while.

I ran over the the armory for lunch and then came back and worked on getting my VM linux install finished and submitting my assignments in Canvas. I think I was late on a few submissions. I didn't realize I had assignments that needed submission before class...

It was a good first day. :)
