# # LJ Code 201 - Day 8

So I really enjoyed going over my code and found it both awesome and depressing simultaneously that I was so close to getting it all working.

The pair project was actually pretty fun. We got further than I expected and what we DID get done was very close to the PDF.

I'm tired, but excited for week three. I don't know that I have ever learned so much in such a short amount of time.
