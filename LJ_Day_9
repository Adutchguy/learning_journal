# # LJ Code 201 - Day 9

Man, Monday through Wednesday were brutal. I feel like have learned more in the last week and a half than I have in 3 years of life.

I still feel like I am fighting to stay afloat in the learning process. I find myself exhausted mentally. Just want to take a day and sleep.

Code review has been quite helpful in resolving the questions I have from the night before.
