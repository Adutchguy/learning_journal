# # LJ Code 201 - Day 7

I always come in thinking that I'm in a good place and maybe even ahead of the game. Then, post lecture, it quickly breaks down to a brutal push to get through the assignment. certainly not the first person to experience this. But man, it's rough.

I think I was able to get the desired results after staying late, till about 8:45PM. Now I just gotta grind through the reading.

I feel like maybe, just maybe, I'm getting the hang of the for loops.

The way that object methods roll into each other is crazy. It can get super confusing.
