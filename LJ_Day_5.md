# # LJ Code 201 - Day 5

Started the day thinking that I would be finishing ahead for the weekend.

My partner for the day 4 assignment was having issues and I decided to help him get his system all set up. Namely the linter and his terminal. Once that was done we started working with GitHub and doing the forking and whatnot. It was slow going.

By the time I got to today's assignment I only had a few hours. At least I got through problem three which according to various classmates means I should be able to relatively cruise through the last two. **fingers crossed**.
