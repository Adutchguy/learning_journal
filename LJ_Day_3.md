# # LJ Code 201 - Day 3

As of today I am starting to feel overwhelmed. I am getting hung up on the for/while loops in conjunction with the if/else statements. It's eating up a great deal of my time.

I will have to spend time this weekend catching up. I can already tell. I need to be sure to ask for help from the TA's more frequently when I get hung up.
